# Unidom - CS480CourseProject

This is an Android application written in Java submitted as the final project to my CS480 course - a course on exploring emerging application development technologies. 

It is an app designed to connect students from neighboring college together by providing an all-in-one platform that includes the following features:
- User Accounts
- Built-in To-Do List
- Tutoring Scheduling
- Google Maps API Integration
- General College Information & Resources

Users' information are stored into a SQLite DB upon account creation. Can be run on an Android emulator.
